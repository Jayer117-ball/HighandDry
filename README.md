## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Download Wabbajack

Go to the [Wabbajack website](https://www.wabbajack.org/) and download the latest version.

### 2. Create a Modding Folder

Create a new folder **outside** of default Windows folders (e.g., **not in Documents or Program Files**).

Example:
C:\Modding\Wabbajack

### 3. Run Wabbajack

Move `Wabbajack.exe` to your new folder and run it.

### 4. Select Installation Location

Create a **separate**, empty folder for the modlist installation.

Example:
C:\Modding\HighAndDry

### 5. Begin Installation

In Wabbajack:

- Select your installation and download folders
- Click **Begin Installation**
- If you don‚Äôt have a Nexus Premium account, you‚Äôll need to manually download each mod

### 6. Finish Installation

- ‚úÖ If successful: You'll see **"Installation Complete"**
- ‚ùå If failed: Log in to Nexus Mods again via Wabbajack and try reinstalling
- ‚ùå If failed: Validate files in Steam

---

## üì¶ Post-Installation Steps

### üîÅ Run 4GB Patch

1. Open **Mod Organizer 2** that shipped with High and Dry
2. Click the Executable drop down and click on **FNVPatch**
- Check to see if the Binary path is correct before running the patcher
- https://github.com/Jayer117-ball/HighandDry/blob/main/4GB%20Patch.png
4. MO2 will load the application
5. After running `FNVpatch` ‚Äî it should confirm:  
   `FalloutNV.exe patched!`

### üìú Install Vanilla UI Extension

1. Download [Vanilla UI Extension](https://www.moddb.com/mods/vanilla-ui-extension/downloads/vanilla-ui-extension-10)
2. Install it manually through **Mod Organizer 2**
3. Place it **after Vanilla UI Plus** in the left pane

### ‚öôÔ∏è DXVK or Heap Replacer (Choose One)

- **Default (Recommended):** DXVK 2.7
- **Alternative:** New Vegas Heap Replacer. Older, not up to date

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Only use one**, not both

---

## üöÄ First-Time Launch

- Launch **Fallout: New Vegas through Steam** once to generate config files
- Let it detect your resolution, then close it
- Always launch the game via **Mod Organizer 2**

---

## üìù Notes

- Expand the **separators in MO2** and read notes on individual mods. Most notes can be expanded for more information.
- Some mods have extra features or useful usage tips

---

## üîÑ Updating the Modlist

To update:

1. Re-download the Wabbajack file ‚Äî it will update automatically

2. For any manually added mods:
- Add `[NoDelete]` to their names

3. Add `[NoDelete]` to:
- Vanilla UI Extension

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optional Steps

### üßÉ BSA Decompressor

- Go to your installation folder
- Run `FNV BSA Decompressor.exe`  
‚Üí Reduces load times and stutters

### üåÉ New Vegas Reloaded (NVR)

1. Download the **latest Nightly Build** from [TES Reloaded Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BYY7SNfQeJ)
2. In MO2:
- Set NVR load order:
  - **823** = Normal/HC
  - **545** = Performance
- Enable:
  - Cartographer
  - NVR - Lucky 38 Shadows Fix
  - High and Dry NVR Main Menu Replacer
  - Desert Natural Weathers + Performance + Dry Wells Patch
  - Neutral Weathers
  - Caffeine NVR + Performance + RTR

  - SFX NVR Pack
  - Special Series ‚Äì Fire Barrel FX
  - NVR versions of:
    - Lucky 38 Exterior Remastered
    - Strip Cinematic Lighting Overhaul

- Disable:
  - Weathers Revised + Weather Variation + the Lucky 38 Lights Redone patch (located in the **Weather Visuals** separator)
  - 3D Rain + patches
  - High Resolution Bloom
  - Non-NVR versions of the mods of:
    - Lucky 38 Exterior Remastered
    - Strip Cinematic Lighting Overhaul

### üîß Shader Package

This mod is optional but it does fix directional reflctions in your game, I recommend it.

1. Navigate to:  
Documents\My Games\FalloutNV
2. Open `RendererInfo.txt`
3. Find your **shader model** (2nd line from bottom)
4. Download the correct [shader package](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/69135) based on your model
5. Install it into MO2 like any other mod

---

## üéÆ Running the Game

There are **3 profiles**:

- **Normal:** 2K textures
- **Performance:** 1K textures
- **Hardcore:** Same as Normal + extra hardcore mods

> üîπ Run the game through **MO2**
>  
> ‚ùå Do **NOT** use Fallout Launcher or NVSE directly

- Fallout Launcher will appear the **first time** ‚Äî that's okay
- Close it and relaunch the game via MO2
