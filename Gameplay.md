# 🎮 High & Dry – Gameplay & Content Overhauls

This document outlines all **gameplay changes, content expansions, and mechanical overhauls** included in the **High & Dry** modlist for *Fallout: New Vegas*.

The goal of these mods is to **modernize gameplay, deepen immersion, and rebalance systems** while preserving the core identity of New Vegas.

## 📌 Design Philosophy

High & Dry gameplay changes focus on:

- Enhancing immersion without turning New Vegas into a different game
- Encouraging thoughtful combat, exploration, and role-playing
- Reducing exploits, bullet sponges, and outdated mechanics
- Adding meaningful content that feels **lore-friendly and intentional**

This is **not** a hardcore survival sim or a pure vanilla experience — it sits comfortably in between.

## ⚔️ Gameplay

### 💰 Loot
- Famine: loot scarcity mod using event-based scripting
- Armor Rarity

### 🔊 Speech
- Charisma is no longer a dump stat. Multiple conditions may now display in a single dialogue option/topic.

## 🔫 Combat Gameplay

### 🔫 Gunplay
- Grenade quickthrow | G to throw, H to change
- Immersive critical effects
- Headshots matter
- FPS dashing | left alt
- Alleviates New Vegas's bullet sponge problem by adding damage bonuses against vulnerable players and enemies

### 🐾 Creatures
- Enemies are faster and more aggressive, so they're able to consistently close the gap and deal damage
- UnLeveled
- More spawn points
- Ghouls are harder by design. REPCONN should be difficult to get to and hard to complete. IMO it is an important quest that leads the Courier to respect preparation, positioning, and the dangers of the Mojave early on.

### 🤠 NPC's
- Sprint
- Prone
- Use Chems
- UnLeveled

### 🧠 AI & NPC Behavior
- Pick up weapons much quicker
